### Study Overview
We are conducting a study to compare two programming approaches:
1. **Prompt-Based Programming**: Our novel approach.
2. **Traditional Syntax Programming**: The method you have learned in class.

### Study Goals
The goal is to determine whether individuals with no prior programming knowledge can use our novel prompt-based tool to achieve faster and more accurate analytical outputs. Each participant will serve as their own control, ensuring a fair comparison.

### Confidentiality and Voluntary Participation
- **Confidentiality**: There are no disclosure risks, as we will not keep your names.
- **Voluntary Participation**: Since grades have already been submitted to the Academic Registrar, your participation is entirely voluntary.

### How to Participate
1. **Instructional Video**: Please watch the instructional video below.
   <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Rhven0E4ScYyXCglE2-Fv8opJQ4etV9/preview" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
2. **Transcribed Steps**:
    - **Run the Remote Script**:
      ```stata
      // Created by watching the video 
      do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vince-Jin/Prompt/main/navigation.do"
      ```
    - **Comparison of Programming Approaches**: You will complete tasks using both prompt-based and syntax-based programming.

### Key Outcome Measure: Time-to-Completion
The primary outcome measure is the time it takes to complete each approach. The tasks are straightforward, and we will provide hints if needed.

### Data Collection
Once you complete both programs, you will see a prompt with your results. An example of the output is:
```lua
Now you have completed this pilot program!
Generating the log file for running time: 
Running time for Pilot Programs: 
Prompt-Based (Q1): 71.11
Traditional (Q2): 260.37
```

### Survey
Please complete six simple, **and anonymous**, survey questions on Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQxx83eX7sIIDbyV8frowY8EXuYpRAuudRxnVdfNSQg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Thank You
Your participation will help shape the future of Stata programming instruction. We greatly appreciate the time and effort you put into this study, and your contributions will significantly benefit future students.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to support the next generation of learners!

Best regards,

Vince & Abi
