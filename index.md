# Transcribed Steps

### 1. Run the following remote script

```stata
// Created by watching the video 
do "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vince-Jin/Prompt/main/navigation.do"
```

### 2. Prompt-based vs. Syntax-based Programming

Thank you so much for participating in the pilot program for the prompt-based programming approach!

In this program, we will run programs to complete certain tasks. Think of this as a trial of "Prompt-based" programming (a novel approach being tested) vs. "Syntax-based" programming (the standard approach we teach at Hopkins).

### 3. Key Outcome Measure: Time-to-Completion

Since the outcome measure is time, we can't predict how long it will take you to complete the "Prompt-based" approach or the "Syntax-based" approach. But the tasks aren't complex. Kindly be patient and follow the prompts; we will include hints when the program recognizes that you're having a little trouble.

### 4. Data Collection

Once you've completed the trial program (prompt-based) as well as the control program (syntax-based), you will see a prompt that looks like this:

```lua
Now you have completed this pilot program!
Generating the log file for running time: 
Running time for Pilot Programs: 
Prompt-Based (Q1): 71.10599999999999
Traditional (Q2): 260.37

### 5. Thank You for Helping Future Stata Students!

We appreciate the time you've put aside to complete this survey. Each year helps the next to have a better experience. So we thank you on behalf of all the future students of this course!
